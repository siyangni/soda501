# Project Introduction 



## Welcome

Welcome to the official repo for SODA 501's group project repo. This is the place we collaborate for data analysis. It won't be very useful until the later stage of this project. However, it is good we set up the toolbox in the early stage.



## General Rule

1. Please only keep markdown files (like this one) and source code files (for data integration and analysis) in this repo. **Do not push data file to this repo**. This repo is public at present. Also, generally, it is not a recommended practice to keep datafile on Github repo.
2. To keep the workflow simple, we will all **use the master branch** instead of everyone working on a separate branch. 
3. Please **comment your code**, especially when your code invokes some functions from a not commonly-known package, or you write your own function.  
4. Whenever unsure, **comment out your code** instead of removing it. 
5. Try to **comment your commit**, especially those ones that make substantial change to the code.
